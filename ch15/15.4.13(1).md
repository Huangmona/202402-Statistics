## a.


Table :

Calculate the difference. (A-B)

| Intersection |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10  |  11  |  12  |
| :----------: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| A            | 5   | 6   | 8   | 3   | 6   | 1   | 2   | 4   | 7   | 5    | 6    | 1    |
| B            | 4   | 4   | 9   | 2   | 3   | 0   | 3   | 1   | 9   | 2    | 5    | 1    |
| Difference   | 1   | 2   | -1  | 1   | 3   | 1   | -1  | 3   | -2  | 3    | 1    | 0    |


1. $H_0$ : There is no difference between the two population distributions. <br>
   $H_a$ : There is a difference between the two population distributions.

2. Set $\alpha = 0.05 $

3. Test statistic T = sum of positive differences.

4.  Positive differences $(\+\)$: 8 <br>
    Negative differences $(\-\)$: 3 <br>
    Ties: 1

5. Realized statistic: $T^* = 8 $

6. Check the table with $n$ ＝ 11 ( Since one tie , thus $n$ = 12 - 1 ) and $p = 0.5 $

8. Two-tailed test, $\ p\text{-value} = 2 P(X \geq 8 \mid n = 11, p = 0.5)$

8. The $\ p\text{-value} = 2(1 - 0.887) = 2 * 0.113 = 0.226$ <br>
   0.226 > $\alpha$ = 0.05 <br>
   Do not reject $H_0$ <br><br>
   There is insufficient evidence to indicate a difference in the distributions of accident rates for traffic control methods A and B.



## b.


Table :

Use the table above, add the rank row. <br>
Rank the absolute values of the differences from smallest to the largest. <br>
If there is the same difference, the value is divided by the total sum of the ranks. 

| Intersection |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10  |  11  |  12  |
| :----------: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| A            | 5   | 6   | 8   | 3   | 6   | 1   | 2   | 4   | 7   | 5    | 6    | 1    |
| B            | 4   | 4   | 9   | 2   | 3   | 0   | 3   | 1   | 9   | 2    | 5    | 1    |
| Difference   | 1   | 2   | -1  | 1   | 3   | 1   | -1  | 3   | -2  | 3    | 1    | 0    |
| Rank         | 3.5 | 7.5 | 3.5 | 3.5 | 10  | 3.5 | 3.5 | 10  | 7.5 | 10   | 3.5  |      |
| Signed rank  | 3.5 | 7.5 | -3.5| 3.5 | 10  | 3.5 |-3.5 | 10  |-7.5 | 10   | 3.5  |      |


  
1. <br>
   $H_0$ : There is no difference between the two population distributions. <br>
   $H_a$ : There is a difference between the two population distributions.

3. Set $\alpha$ = 0.05

4. Test Statistic T = $min(T^+,\ \ T^-)$

5. $T^+ = 3.5 + 7.5 + 3.5 + 10 + 3.5 + 10 + 10 + 3.5 = 51.5$ <br>
   $T^- = 3.5 + 3.5 + 7.5 = 14.5$ 

6. Realized Statistic $(T^*) = min(51.5,\ \ 14.5)= 14.5$

7. Check the table with $n$ ＝ 11 ( Since one tie , thus $n$ = 12 - 1 ), $\alpha$ = 0.05 and two-tailed test.<br>

         $T_0$ $= 11$

8. Rejection region $`= \{T \leq 11\}`$ <br>
   $(T^*)$ ＝ 14.5 $\notin$ rejection region. <br>
   Do not reject $H_0$ <br><br>
   There is insufficient evidence to indicate a difference in the distributions of accident rates for traffic control methods A and B.
